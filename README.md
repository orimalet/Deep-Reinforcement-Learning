# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Exercise on Deep Reinforcement Learning using openAI gym

This exercise aims at designing and implementing a deep reinforcement learning agent for a video game from OpenAI Gym. You must also include a brief report describing and discussing your solutions to the problems.
 You should: 
•	import an OpenAI Gym game
•	create a network
•	connect the game to the network
•	most importantly, implement the deep reinforcement learning model
•	discuss the experimental results in the report
